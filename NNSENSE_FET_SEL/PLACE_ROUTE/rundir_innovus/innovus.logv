[08/29 13:45:29    157]       default_route_type_leaf (M1-M5) was replaced by default_route_type_leaf_ccopt_autotrimmed (M2-M4);
[08/29 13:45:29    157]         Layer M5 is trimmed off because its RC characteristic is very different from its adjacent layers.
[08/29 13:45:29    157]         Layer M1 is trimmed off because its RC characteristic is not good
[08/29 13:45:29    157]       default_route_type_nonleaf (M1-M5) was replaced by default_route_type_nonleaf_ccopt_autotrimmed (M2-M4);
[08/29 13:45:29    157]         Layer M5 is trimmed off because its RC characteristic is very different from its adjacent layers.

[08/29 13:45:29    157]     To disable this behavior, either reduce the range of allowed layers or set the property "route_type_autotrim" to false.
